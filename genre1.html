      <p class="leftindent">The methods of the past are not lost to time,
      but rather are alive today,the torch being carried 
      by the innovators of tomorrow. 
      The treasures of the past flourish the designs of today.
      These people are rediscovering the traditions once sequestered
      and are integrating them into their modern practice.  
      </p>
      
      <p class="leftindent">The artisan places his livelihood in to his
        work, and is distinguished from the artist in the timeliness
        of his creation. The artisan always has a deadline he must
        take consideration of. In the devotion to his craft, the artisan
        develops an ethos surrounding his trade. Because his work is dictated
        first by the needs of the client, the artisan faces the struggle between
        the desires of his craft and of his client.
      </p>
      
      <p class="leftindent">In each art there is a goal that the art provides for. 
        In the pursuit of these aims the artisan contributes his own techniques and methods,
        and thus builds to the wealth of the art. The wealth of each art can be harvested to
        aid in the goals of another. Each art has its general application that confers beyond itself.
        Insofar, each discipline is entwined in its knowledge and can collectively reap
        the combined benefits. For example, although origami may be at its essence the art
        of folding paper to approximate other forms, its general knowledge includes methods
        of folding and techniques of material conservation, which can readily be applied to
        other fields such as the manufacture and machining of metals.
      </p>
        
      <p class="leftindent">The modern methods of creation find themselves devoid of this pride
        and passion, the caring hands of the laborer replaced by the enduring manufacture of
        the machine. But this is not to say that the fruits of the arts cannot be applied in
        the mechanical age, but rather the artisan must take a step back an utilise these machines
        as tools in themselves. Just as the plasterer does not loathe his trowel for taking work
        away from his hand, so too must the modern artisan
        take the machine into his repertoire and into his art.
