      <p class="centered">The methods of the past are not lost to time,
      but rather are alive today,the torch being carried 
      by the innovators of tomorrow. 
      The treasures of the past flourish the designs of today.
      These people are rediscovering the traditions once sequestered
      and are integrating them into their modern practice.

      <p class="centered">The artisan places his livelihood in to his
        work, and is distinguished from the artist in the timeliness
        of his creation. The artisan always has a deadline he must
        take consideration of. In the devotion to his craft, the artisan
        develops an ethos surrounding his trade. Because his work is dictated
        first by the needs of the client, the artisan faces the struggle between
        the desires of his craft and of his client.
