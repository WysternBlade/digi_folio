      <h2 class="centered"> On The Nature of The Arts </h2>
      
      <p class="leftindent">The methods of the past are not lost to time,
        but rather are alive today, the torch being carried by the innovators
        of tomorrow. The past exists only insofar as it has been remembered,
        or as the physical remains can describe. Beyond this, the past has
        no physicality. If forgotten, the root of today’s knowledge is also
        lost. And so, people are rediscovering the traditions once
        sequestered and are integrating them into their modern practice. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="leftindent">But before we can begin to understand the nature
        of the modernization of the arts, we must first ask and answer,
        “What is an art?” In each art there is a goal that the art provides for.
        In the pursuit of these aims the artisan contributes his own techniques and 
        methods, and thus builds to the wealth of the art. The wealth of an art is slowly constructed,
        with each generation of artisans adding their own riches to the pile.
        The apprentice then inherits this wealth to spend upon his own aesthetic desires, furthering 
        the art. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="leftindent">The wealth of each art can be used to aid
        in the goals of another. And so each art has its general
        application that confers beyond itself. Insofar, each discipline
        is intertwined in its knowledge and can reap the combined benefits.
        For example, although origami may be at its essence the art of folding
        paper to approximate other forms, its general knowledge includes
        methods of folding and techniques of material conservation, which
        can readily be applied to other fields such as the manufacture and machining of metals.  
     </p>
        
      <p class="leftindent">But there is more to an art than the aims
        pursued by its members. The artisan himself is an important
        element to consider, especially in the ethos that surrounds
        his work. The artisan places his livelihood in to his work,
        and is distinguished from the artist in the timeliness of his
        creation. The artisan always has a deadline he must take consideration of.
        Because his work is dictated first by the needs of the client, the artisan
        faces the struggle between the desires of his craft and of his client.
        This conflict nurtures the innovation of the craft by forcing the artisan
        to find solutions that satisfy both his sense of aesthetic and the requests of the other party.  
      </p>
      
      <p class="leftindent">Regrets are harbored from those tasks left incomplete
        in the eyes of the creator, but unable to turn back time, he must
        merely accept the past and seek to improve his position in the future.
        This anxiety is a characteristic feature of the artisan, fueling his passion
        and fastidiousness towards new ventures in his art. Regrets leave lasting 
        impressions on those who harbor them, the knowledge thus gained leaves and 
        indelible mark on the soul of the creator. These marks when pooled
        together paint the perspective of their bearer, and give color and depth to his aesthetic insights. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="leftindent">The philosophy that underpins the production of works differs
        from creator to creator, but common threads can be found connecting them. Each 
        philosophy necessarily deals with the aesthetic concerns of the artisan, as in 
        the creation of each work the artisan starts first with a design in the mind
        the finished product simply being a manifestation of that first idea, a physical
        copy of that mental image. In the approximation of forms the artisan conducts the 
        art of his craft.
      </p>
      
      <p class="leftindent">The modern methods of creation find themselves devoid of this
        pride and passion. The above advantages which are brought about by the human nature 
        of struggle and determination are absent, the caring hands of the laborer replaced by
        the enduring manufacture of the machine. But this is not to say that the benefits of
        the arts cannot be applied in the mechanical age, but rather the artisan must take a
        step back and utilise these machines as tools in themselves. Just as the plasterer does
        not loathe his trowel for taking work away from his hand, so too must the modern artisan
        take the machine into his repertoire and into his art. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="leftindent"> This new art, of using manufacturing techniques and ideas
        devised for human ability and enhancing them with mechanical advantage and
        precision creates a class of works whose quality far exceeds both the artisanal
        products, and normally mass-produced ones. This art represents the frontier of
        product creation, creating new fields of design as compliant mechanisms and the such.
        With the advent of this new art, new ideals will be able to be represented in physical form,
        the barrier to manifestation having been lowered by new manufacturing techniques.
        This edge of knowledge is an ennobling and humbling place, where the new creators will
        have to stand on their own, supported only by the traditions that have been developed hitherto. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="leftindent"> New ideals will have to be created, to sustain these new arts,
        to give them their new aims and purposes. And so we enter into the age of the unknown,
        where artisans need to not only be the disseminators of values, but their creators as well.
        These new ideals must not only encompass the object of their creation, but so too must the objects
        encompass their values. And thus a cycle of revaluation and creation continues, for as long as man
        needs meaning to underpin his life.
