    <h2 class="centered"> The Song of Serendipity </h2>
    
    <p class="left"> The tree of knowledge will bear its boon,
      <br> The transformative shell, the still cocoon.
      <br> The fruit of change, alive and light,
      <br> Still carries on the eternal fight. 
      <br> A war against the dark and unknown,
      <br>To see what is, but isn’t shown.
    </p>
    
    <p class="left"> And at the stem is fruit thus born, 
      <br> To carry its seed through seminal forlorn.
      <br> A lonely world it seems to be,
      <br> If all the leaves on all the trees, 
      <br> Bear each toward their own end
      <br> Without repair, another’s mend.
    </p>
    
    <p class="left"> And of every art and craft and trade,
      <br> Where are they without the other’s spade,
      <br> To dig up soil for seeds to plant,
      <br> To create life where others can’t.
      <br> And thus they lend the helping hand,
      <br> Through combined strength, they together stand. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="left"> The resultant art thus makes its start,
      <br> Bearing signs of its constituent parts.
      <br> A craft born of zeal and pride,
      <br> Of which it takes purity inside. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="left"> Without a foundation upon which to stand, 
      <br> What can be built up of that man?
      <br> Instead of completing, he seeks to try,
      <br> He seeks to soar, when he should learn to fly. 
      <br> Like the lobster upon the rock,
      <br> He waits for a wave from which to knock,
      <br> Him into the ocean, back to his life, 
      <br> From whence he came, having gained nothing from strife. 
      <br> Such is he who is without which to strive,
      <br> A man sans will, a man sans drive. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="left"> The purest expression of the ideal,
      <br> What one can touch, but cannot feel. 
      <br> Of such we need to fill the mind and hearts,
      <br> Of those who contribute to our arts. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="left"> And so each profession may live another day,
      <br> Revived in technology, it follows its way.
      <br> Along its path it reaches world’s end, 
      <br> And so builds a trail to where it descends, 
      <br> To be lost for some time, and later be found,
      <br> As the cycle of knowledge continues around.
      <br> And into its dead lungs, is blown the breath of life,
      <br>As it comes into being, content with its flight. 
    </p>
     
    <h4 class="centered"> And so the cycle continues to turn,
      <br> As long as man continues to yearn.
