    <h2 class="centered"> The Song of Serendipity </h2>
    
    <p class="left"> The tree of knowledge will bear its boon,
      <br> The transformative shell, the still cocoon.
      <br> The fruit of change, alive and light,
      <br> Still carries on the eternal fight. 
      <br> A war against the dark and unknown,
      <br>To see what is, but isn’t shown.
    </p>
    
    <p class="left"> And at the stem is fruit thus born, 
      <br> To carry its seed through seminal forlorn.
      <br> A lonely world it seems to be,
      <br> If all the leaves on all the trees, 
      <br> Bear each toward their own end
      <br> Without repair, another’s mend.
    </p>
    
    <p class="left"> And of every art and craft and trade,
      <br> Where are they without the other’s spade,
      <br> To dig up soil for seeds to plant,
      <br> To create life where others can’t.
      <br> And thus they lend the helping hand,
      <br> Through combined strength, they together stand. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="left"> The resultant art thus makes its start,
      <br> Bearing signs of its constituent parts.
      <br> A craft born of zeal and pride,
      <br> Of which it takes purity inside.
